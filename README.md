# Jai's ARPG Rollers

Howdy!! Thanks so much for downloading my rollers resource! I highly recommend that you have at least a functional understanding of HTML, CSS, JSON, and Javascript/JQuery 
if you are choosing to use this open-source roller code. I used the most basic possible options for this framework, so that problems and questions
can be easily looked up online. 

To use and edit these rollers, have a Git software (ex. Github, Sourcetree, Fork, etc) ready and clone/pull the remote. In case I ever edit anything to the source,
you will be able to fetch and pull the changes as well! 
Please have a text or code editing software on hand! I like the ATOM software, since it's free and easy to understand.
I like Neocities.org for my rollers, because they allow you to upload files quicky and easily to a website, and they also have their own built-in editor.

Please understand that, outside of glaring issues or bugs that are directly related to my rollers and NOT a product of user editing, 
I will not be providing free support to rollers that were not made by me (via commissions, or gifts for friends). 
If you are using this free resource, it is with the understanding that you are on your own from here on out!
StackOverflow is excellent for reference if you are having problems or are less experienced with coding! http://stackoverflow.com

Additionally, please do not take money or commissions to edit my roller frameworks for other people. I do not intend to persecute people who may do this
but it's still rude and disrespectful to me, as I already offer this resource for free or as commissions, myself.

If you are interested in commissioning me for a roller, please visit my comm page: https://seabirdtestroller.neocities.org/rollercomms.html

Thank you for understanding!
